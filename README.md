Enhancements for a Robust Production Solution
Security Enhancements:

Password Hashing: Ensure passwords are hashed using Django's built-in mechanisms.
CSRF Protection: Use CSRF tokens in forms (already included with {% csrf_token %}).
Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks.
Secure Cookies: Ensure cookies are secure and have appropriate attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite).
Scalability:

Database Indexing: Ensure relevant fields are indexed for quick lookups.
Caching Strategy: Use a robust caching backend (like Redis or Memcached).
Load Balancing: Ensure the application can scale horizontally with load balancers.
Code Structure and Best Practices:

Modular Code: Separate logic into different modules/files.
Error Handling: Add comprehensive error handling and logging.
Testing: Write unit and integration tests.
